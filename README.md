# Landing-page
HEllo Today i start the project landing page exercise, will be coming back and filling one to two things here in the Readme files.
Today 19 April 2022 i finished my landing page project, it took me seven days to finish my project, reason is i have a side job hustle i do to get money and buy data to use on my laptop, also where i reside there isnt light, i had to go to a far place everyday from 8am to 4pm. Nevertheless which the help of my last flex exercise and also searching some code on W3school helped me alot through the project. I felt happy doing the project from the scratch.
